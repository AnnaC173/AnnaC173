- 👋 Hi, I’m @AnnaC173
- 👀 I’m interested in Philosophy, Digital Marketing, Nature, Religion, Politics....and some coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many things, but my focus for the next 30 days is Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on an idea that migrants in the UK should be able to prepare their Immigration Letter without the help of a lawyer. There should be an easy app to do this. I used to be an immigration lawyer and therefore know this area really well.
- 📫 You can contact me through email: acaingcoy01@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I qualified as a lawyer in 2005 without following the usual route of getting GSCE or A Levels.
